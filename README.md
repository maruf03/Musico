# Musico 
### Musico is a platform that basically works as an audio player. Along with listening songs one can view different sort of spectrums, can play with sounds a little bit using audio effects, can simulate notes using the instrument simulator and can generate different sounds by just hovering the mouse using the audio synthesizer.

### •	Fast and user friendly UI that lets the user easily navigate from one option to another.
# Platform:
### 1.	Windows 32/64 bit
### 2.	Linux 32/64 bit
### 3.	MacOS (not tested yet)
### 4.	Android(Touch and Gesture not implemented)
# Tools:
### 1.	Openframeworks
### 2. ofxDatGui
# Limitations:
### Exporting Audio files is only limited to the synthesizer and Musico can only export to WAVE(pcm) format. Currently Touch and Gesture support is not implemented and therefore Musico is not completely portable to Smart phones i.e. Android. 
# Future Plan:
### a.	Adding Audio fingerprinting.
### b.	Export to standard audio formats(mp3, ogg, flac).
### c.	More Visualization.
### d.	More Effect (reverb, echo etc).
### e.	Implementing multi-Touch and Gesture User Interface.
