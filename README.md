# Musico 
### Musico is a platform that basically works as an audio player. Along with listening songs one can view different sort of spectrums, can play with sounds a little bit using audio effects, can simulate notes using the instrument simulator and can generate different sounds by just hovering the mouse using the audio synthesizer. 

## Features:
### •	Listening to a song and viewing its spectrum.
